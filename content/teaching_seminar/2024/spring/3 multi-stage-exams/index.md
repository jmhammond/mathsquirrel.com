Dr. Bill Ingle presented an overview of different methods of exams. He personally gives multiple-stage exams in which students are given an in-class conceptual test, measuring their knowledge of definitions and theorems, and then gives a second take-home portion on which the students perform the tedious calculations that are better done at home.  He does this in his linear algebra and calculus 3 classes. 

Hammond (that's me!) noted that he's going to be attempting a variant of this in calculus 1 this semester for the midterm exams. We'll see how that goes!
