Rachel Heckman presented her use of "attendance quizzes" in trigonometry and elementary statistics.  Basically, students are given a couple questions to work at the end of class that measure how they're doing the material that they learned that day. Some days also include review from recent topics. 

This counts both as a measure of how students are learning (useful for the next lecture), and also as a simple way to determine whether students were in class.  

Afterwards, we learned that a couple attendees (including one GTA!) have adopted the use of attendance quizzes and report success!
