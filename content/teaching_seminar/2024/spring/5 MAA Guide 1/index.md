# MAA instructional Practices Guide
Part 1 of 7 - Fostering Student Engagement

[You can find the MAA Instructional Guide here](https://maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/books/members/NTE89.pdf) hosted on the MAA's site. 

## Active Learning

> Classroom practices aimed at fostering student engagement attend to the research-based idea that students learn best when they are engaged in their learning (e.g., Freeman, et al., 2014) [^1]

But don't worry too much!

## "Active" Learning

> Freeman et al. (2014) coded active learning as “intensities ranging from 10% to 100% of class time.” 
> Think about that. This study, a phenomenally important, heavily cited meta-analysis, classified a session as active learning if there were 5  minutes of an in-class worksheet or a clicker question in a 50-minute class session. 
> That means this is not lecture versus active learning; it is all-lecture learning versus lecture plus active learning  [^2]

## Practices Fostering Student Engagement

Before we dig in individually, let's look at the list: 

- Building a classroom community
- Wait time
- responding to student contributions in the classroom
- one-minute paper or exit tickets
- collaborative learning strategies

## Discussion:

In small groups, discuss (~ 3-5 minutes) then we'll share out:

- What are you already using?  
  - How is it going? where could it improve?


Practices:

- Building a classroom community
- Wait time
- responding to student contributions in the classroom
- one-minute paper or exit tickets
- collaborative learning strategies

## As we discuss it all together:

Please think about: 

- What is one thing you can implement in your classroom today/tomorrow to increase engagement for all students? 
- What will have to change in your preparation for class to ensure the change above can happen?
- How will you determine if the implementation is effective? 

- (would you like to take 2-3 minutes to write down ideas?)

## Practices Fostering Student Engagement

Now let's dig into each together as a community: 

- Building a classroom community
- Wait time
- responding to student contributions in the classroom
- one-minute paper or exit tickets
- collaborative learning strategies
