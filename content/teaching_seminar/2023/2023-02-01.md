Some notes / links from this week's teaching seminar
<!--more-->

John's recommendations: 
- A case a against points: ["When is a number not a number?"](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/when-is-a-number-not-a-number) by Robert Talbert.  Arguing that 'points' are categorical, not numerical data.
- How I'm grading in my courses: [Non-traditional grading: Mastery-based testing](https://jmhammond.github.io/blog/non_traditional_grading1/)  It's a typed version of the talk I gave at the [ARC in August 2022](https://wichita.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e5d0bcde-6686-47dd-bc22-aef3016c2966). 
- ... and I have so much more to share in the future. I'm limiting myself to just two recommendations this week, but I'm excited to talk to you all about teaching!

Rob's recommendation: remember extrinsic rewards/motivation doesn't motivate students to learn.  We need to think about how to build intrinsic motivation.

Aubrey's recommendation: the "ERIC" method of positive motivation towards mistakes
- **E**xpect mistakes
- **R**espect mistakes
- **I**nspect mistakes
- **C**orrect mistakes


[Daniel's website is full of great information](https://www.math.wichita.edu/~trousdale/) and delightful comic illustrations ([including the "ERIC" approach](https://www.math.wichita.edu/~trousdale/positive/))


We're going to be meeting in the seminar room at 11am every Tuesday and 2pm on Wednesdays. Come by and say hello and let's chat about teaching!
