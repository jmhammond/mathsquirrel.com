Originally, we planned to discuss summative assessment informed by our reading. However, we began having a very productive conversation regarding having difficult academic conversations with our students (in particular, the pros and cons of recommending a student withdraw rather than take a failing grade). We also discussed our semesters in general, and it was a very good and needed conversation.


## Initial Draft: 
We continue our series of reading and working through the [MAA Instructional Practices Guide](https://nextcloud.math.wichita.edu/index.php/s/T82WC4YNSizG5km). This is part 5, in which we review pages 59-66 on the basics of assessment. 


### Thinking about course grades

The text begins by contrasting a traditional grading system with one that uses portfolios. It then makes reference to [non-traditional grading](../../../../posts/2023/non_traditional_grading1/).

#### Modified Bloom's taxonomy

The text shares a two-dimensional variation on Bloom's Taxonomy referring to Anderson, et.al[^1]:
