# MAA instructional Practices Guide
Part 2 of 7 - Fostering Student Engagement

## "Active" Learning Reminder

> That means this is not lecture versus active learning; it is all-lecture learning versus lecture plus active learning

## Practices Fostering Student Engagement

Before we dig in individually, let's look at the list: 

- Just-in-time teaching 
- Developing persistence in problem solving
- Inquiry-based teaching and learning strategies
- Peer instruction and technology

## Discussion:

In small groups, discuss (~ 3-5 minutes) then we'll share out:

- What are you already using?  
  - How it is going? where could it improve?


Practices:

- Just-in-time teaching 
  - (Summer's calc 2 & 3:  Aubrey?)
- Developing persistence in problem solving
  - (Sangami's 012 course, Tuesday)
- Inquiry-based teaching and learning strategies
  - (samples shared below)
- Peer instruction and technology
  - (we can model this with the 4-functions activity)

## Practices Fostering Student Engagement

Now let's dig into each together as a community: 

- Just-in-time teaching 
- Developing persistence in problem solving
- Inquiry-based teaching and learning strategies
- Peer instruction and technology

## Inquiry based learning (IBL) examples 

- [Active Calculus Series](https://activecalculus.org)
- [Calculus for Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://teambasedinquirylearning.github.io/calculus/2024e/frontmatter.html)
- IBL Activies in Discrete, e.g. [(Oscar Levin's text)](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/ch_sequences.html)
- [Inquiry Oriented Linear Algebra](https://iola.math.vt.edu)
- Even more from Steven Clontz and more in the [Team-Based Learning Collaborative](https://sites.google.com/southalabama.edu/tbil/)
- All of these are OERs
