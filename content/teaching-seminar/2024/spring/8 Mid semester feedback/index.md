We've made it halfway through the semester! This week, in lieu of a formal agenda, we'll relax and reflect on small wins from the first half, and goals for the second half. Additionally, we'll discuss mid semester feedback; how we can implement it to improve our classes for the second half of the semester.

### Recommendation: 

Before Spring Break, I encourage you to give your students a mid-semester feedback survey. I've been using a short four question survey from the Yale Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning.[^1]    I've created it as a [Microsoft Form that you can easily duplicate and use for your own classes](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=P2tb4IAZJEuGN1gHcfRN7kTqQV-jQ5lLp46PXvBpP9RUQUtESk01ME5IUkFKQlZVMTZMMUJZSkk4Ui4u&sharetoken=7p3KvRySMp1C8OmdlXea). Just click the "Duplicate" button at the top of the screen to make it yours.
