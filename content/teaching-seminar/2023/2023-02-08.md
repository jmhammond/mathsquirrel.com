Some notes / links from this week's teaching seminar
<!--more-->

This week was all about evaluations of teaching in our department:
- perception vs. assessment:  SPTEs / CES vs evaluations of teaching 
- discussed what "meets expectation" means for teaching
  - we're trying to define it by a minimum standard ("You will come to class on time, you will teach correct mathematics, ...") and this will be discussed with teaching faculty at review time and during onboarding. 
- came to a consensus on an evaluative rubric for teaching to use this semester

We're going to be meeting in the seminar room at 11am every Tuesday and 2pm on Wednesdays. Come by and say hello and let's chat about teaching!
