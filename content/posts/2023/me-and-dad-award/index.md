In 2023, I received the Academy of Effective Teaching Award from Wichita State University.  It's the top teaching award, and I couldn't be prouder.  The best part is that I was able to celebrate with my dad, who also won a teaching award in his career.

I borrowed his tie and wore a suit/blue shirt so I'd match as best as I could! 

He's now retired and made the trip with my mom to be there to celebrate.
