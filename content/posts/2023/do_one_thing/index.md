Try one thing

You've like been hearing all kinds of different ideas, tips, tricks in the ARC conferences, the monthly issues of teaching today, and just chatting with colleagues. 

This is overwhelming! We already are giving 100% helping our students. How can we find more time in the day in order to bring even more? 

Just try one thing. 

It's even better to start with a new idea in the middle of the semester because you've built a rapport with your current students. If you want to experiment with a new lesson technique or assignment or assessment, tell them about it and why you'd like to try it.
