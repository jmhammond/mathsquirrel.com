# AI Historical Hallucinations - The History of Trigonometry

I was interested first and foremost how Euro-centric the LLMs that power Bard and ChatGPT would be.  I'll talk about that at a later time. Right now I want to focus on the historical hallucinations it produced.

## The initial try

### Prompt:
"Let's talk about the development of trigonometry"

### Initial  Response: 

(I'm going to copy and paste it here, but through in some remarks.)

> Sure, I'd be happy to talk about the development of trigonometry.
> The roots of trigonometry can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Babylonia, where mathematicians studied the properties of triangles and used them to solve practical problems. However, the systematic study of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline began in the Hellenistic world, with the work of Hipparchus (c. 190-120 BC). Hipparchus is credited with compiling the first trigonometric table, which listed the values of the sine function for angles from 0 to 180 degrees. He also developed a number of trigonometric identities, which are equations that relate the trigonometric functions of different angles.

Okay, that's fine-ish. Hipparchus is called the 'Father of Trigonometry' and is credited with creating the first table of values for chord lengths that we can say are essentially values of the sine function (I don't like *function* here).  

We don't have those tables, but we're told of their existence. [^1]
[^1]: Citation needed... Here I'm typing off the cuff, but it's Theon of Alexandria (I think) and Claudius Ptolemy that tell us this.

> The next major development in trigonometry came in the work of Ptolemy (c. 100-170 AD). Ptolemy's book, the Almagest, is a comprehensive treatise on astronomy that includes a detailed treatment of trigonometry. Ptolemy's work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and it was through this translation that trigonometry was introduced to the Islamic world.

Yes. This is good. In fact, it *Almagest* is the Latinization of اَلْمَجِسْطِيّ which is basically "the greatest".  In Greek, it was *Mathematike Syntaxis*.  I think it's cool to view trig as the greatest thing.  They must have thought the book was pretty good...

> In the Islamic world, trigonometry was further developed by mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850 AD) and Abu al-Wafa (940-1000 AD). These mathematicians extended the work of Ptolemy and developed new trigonometric identities and techniques. They also applied trigonometry to a wider range of problems, including surveying, navigation, and optics.

We'll come back to this.

> Trigonometry was introduced to Europe in the 12th century, and it quickly became an important tool for mathematicians, astronomers, and engineers. In the 17th century, trigonometry was revolutionized by the work of Isaac Newton and James Stirling. These mathematicians developed new methods for computing trigonometric functions, and they also applied trigonometry to a wider range of problems, including calculus and differential equations.

I mean, okay.

> Today, trigonometry is a fundamental tool in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields. It is used to solve problems involving triangles, circles, and spheres. It is also used to model periodic phenomena, such as sound waves and electromagnetic waves.

Sure.

> Here are some of the key contributors to the development of trigonometry:
> - Hipparchus (c. 190-120 BC)
> - Ptolemy (c. 100-170 AD)
> - Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850 AD)
> - Abu al-Wafa (940-1000 AD)
> - Isaac Newton (1643-1727)
> - James Stirling (1692-1770)

> I hope this gives you a brief overview of the development of trigonometry.

I'm irritated by this. 


### Second try. Remember India? It's a thing. 
Me: "What about Indian contributions?"

#### The Second Reply: 
> Sure, Indian mathematicians made significant contributions to the development of trigonometry. Here are some of the key Indian contributors:
> Aryabhata (c. 476-550 AD): Aryabhata was the first mathematician to use the words "sine" and "cosine" to refer to the trigonometric functions. He also developed a table of sines and a method for calculating tangents.

First, I just have to say that I **love** Aryabhata. After all, he's the guy who begins with: "By the grace of God the precious sunken jewel of true knowledge has been rescued by me, by means of the boat of my own knowledge, from the ocean which consists of true and false knowledge." [^2]
[^2]: Clark, W. E. (1930). The Aryabhatiya Of Aryabhata. The University of Chicago Press. http://archive.org/details/wg011

I'm not crazy about "sine" and "cosine" here as these are Latin words, but I suppose I'm splitting hairs.  As for computing sines we get into "Hawk and Rabbit"-type problems that I adore. It's gruesome. We should talk about it some time...

> Brahmagupta (c. 598-665 AD): Brahmagupta made several important contributions to trigonometry, including the development of a formula for the sum of two sines. He also developed a table of sines that was more accurate than the one developed by Aryabhata.

Well, Brahmagupta did expand on Aryabhata's work. I don't know about sum of two sines. That requires more research by me.

> Bhaskara II (c. 1114-1185 AD): Bhaskara II was a prolific mathematician who made many contributions to trigonometry. He developed a table of sines that was accurate to 8 decimal places, and he also developed a method for calculating tangents that was more accurate than the method developed by Brahmagupta.

You missed Bhaskara I who expanded the mathematical chapter of *Aryabhatiya* and explained what the hell Aryabhata was on about. 

But Bhaskara II did do trig. Okay.

> Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340-1425 AD): Madhava was a leading mathematician of the Kerala school, which was a major center of mathematical research in India during the 14th and 15th centuries. Madhava made significant contributions to the development of trigonometric series, and he is credited with discovering the Taylor series expansions for the sine and cosine functions.

This need some research by me. But maybe we shouldn't call them *Taylor* series? 

> The contributions of Indian mathematicians to trigonometry were significant, and they helped to lay the foundation for the development of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline. Their work was later adopted by Islamic mathematicians, and it eventually made its way to Europe. Today, trigonometry is a fundamental tool in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields. The contributions of Indian mathematicians to this field are still felt today.

... but if they were significant, why didn't you include them before? *sigh*.

Okay... now let's get back to the thing that really raised my ire.

### Prompt 3 - Do you have the right guy?

Me: "What is proof the Al-Khwarizmi contributed to trigonometry?"

#### Response 3: 

> Al-Khwarizmi made several contributions to trigonometry, including:
> He compiled the first table of sine values for angles from 0 to 360 degrees.
> He developed a method for calculating tangent values.
> He introduced the concept of the versine, which is a trigonometric function that is related to the sine function.

He made a *Zij* - a table of values for astronomical purposes. 

> He wrote a book on trigonometry that was translated into Latin and became a standard reference work in Europe for centuries.

Are you thinking of Abu al-Wafa, Thabit ibn Qurra, Omar Khayyam, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, ....?

> The most famous of Al-Khwarizmi's contributions to trigonometry is his table of sine values. This table was compiled using a method that was based on the work of Ptolemy, but Al-Khwarizmi's table was much more accurate. It was also the first table of sine values to be compiled using decimal numbers, which made it easier to use.

The decimal numbers part is legit. Ptolemy in the *Almagest* is using base-60 because it makes fractions generally nice.

> Al-Khwarizmi's method for calculating tangent values was also based on the work of Ptolemy. However, Al-Khwarizmi's method was more accurate and it was also easier to use. This method became the standard method for calculating tangent values in the Islamic world.
> Al-Khwarizmi also introduced the concept of the versine, which is a trigonometric function that is related to the sine function. The versine is defined as 1 - cos(x), where x is an angle. Al-Khwarizmi used the versine to simplify some trigonometric formulas.

Citation needed.

> Al-Khwarizmi's book on trigonometry was titled "The Book of Calculation by Completion and Balancing". This book was translated into Latin in the 12th century and became a standard reference work in Europe for centuries. The book contained a comprehensive treatment of trigonometry, including tables of sine and tangent values, methods for calculating trigonometric functions, and applications of trigonometry to astronomy and surveying.

You're putting too many things into one book. Yes, this was one of the greatest books in mathematics, giving us *algebra* (I'll write a hyphen to exagerate a point: *al-gebra*). It gave us tools to solve linear and quadratic equations. Applications to geomtry. No trig in sight. 

> The contributions of Al-Khwarizmi to trigonometry were significant and they helped to lay the foundation for the development of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline. His work was later adopted by European mathematicians, and it eventually made its way to the rest of the world. Today, trigonometry is a fundamental tool in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields. The contributions of Al-Khwarizmi to this field are still felt today.

### Prompt 4: Now I'm just seeing what happens. 

me: "what book did al-khwarizmi introduce the versine function?"

#### Response 4: 
> Al-Khwarizmi introduced the versine function in his book The Book of Calculation by Completion and Balancing. This book was translated into Latin in the 12th century and became a standard reference work in Europe for centuries. The book contained a comprehensive treatment of trigonometry, including tables of sine and tangent values, methods for calculating trigonometric functions, and applications of trigonometry to astronomy and surveying.

### Prompt 5: 
Me: "can you tell me the content of the book The Book of Calculation by Completion and Balancing."

#### Response 5: 
> Sure. The Book of Calculation by Completion and Balancing (Arabic: الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة, al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābalah; Latin: Liber Algebræ et Almucabola) is an Arabic mathematical treatise on algebra written by Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī around 820 CE. It was a landmark work in the history of mathematics, establishing algebra as an independent discipline.
> The book is divided into two parts. The first part is on the basics of algebra, including the solution of linear and quadratic equations. The second part is on the application of algebra to problems in geometry, including the calculation of areas and volumes.

Better.

### Prompt 6: let's try again:

me: "What book did al-khwarizmi discuss trigonometry?"

#### Response 6: 

> Al-Khwarizmi discussed trigonometry in his book Zīj al-Sindhind. This book was written in the 9th century and it is a comprehensive treatise on astronomy and mathematics. The book contains a chapter on trigonometry, which includes tables of sine and cosine values, methods for calculating trigonometric functions, and applications of trigonometry to astronomy and surveying.
> The book is notable for its use of Indian astronomical and mathematical concepts, as well as its introduction of new trigonometric functions, such as the versine function. The book was translated into Latin in the 12th century and it became a standard reference work in Europe for centuries.
> Here are some of the key contents of the book's trigonometry chapter:
> A definition of trigonometry as "the science of calculating with chords".
> A discussion of the basic trigonometric functions, including the sine, cosine, and tangent functions.
> A treatment of the relationships between the trigonometric functions.
> Tables of sine and cosine values for angles from 0 to 360 degrees.
> Methods for calculating trigonometric functions.
> Applications of trigonometry to astronomy and surveying.
> The book's trigonometry chapter was a major landmark in the history of mathematics. It was the first book to systematically treat trigonometry as an independent discipline, and it introduced a number of new concepts and techniques that had a profound influence on the development of trigonometry in Europe. The book is still studied today by historians of mathematics, and it is considered to be one of the most important works in the history of the subject.

I'm not arguing this time.

### Prompt 6: Try again...

me: "In what book did al-kwharizmi introduce versine?"

#### Response 6: 
> Al-Khwarizmi introduced the versine function in his book Zīj al-Sindhind. This book was written in the 9th century and it is a comprehensive treatise on astronomy and mathematics. The book contains a chapter on trigonometry, which includes tables of sine and cosine values, methods for calculating trigonometric functions, and applications of trigonometry to astronomy and surveying.

Damn you for your inconsistency! See prompt 4.
