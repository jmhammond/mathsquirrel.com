I received a lot of help working on the Undergraduate Research Conference, and in particular was helped by a wonderful individual in the Rhatigan Student Center. To thank her, I offered to crochet a toy, and when I asked her what kind of animal she liked, she replied that she loved shih tzu dogs. 

Uh oh!

Thankfully there was a wonderful pattern by [Nataliia Gertsyk on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/realistic-shih-tzu-dog). 

The fuzzy yarn is awful to work with, so it look over a month between starting a finishing. Most of that time ignoring the project because it was terrible.

But I found out last week that she's retiring on Thursday!

Uh oh again! 

I got back to work making the legs and head.  I ordered the dog-shaped nose specially, and it really makes the face look realistic.

I got to sewing this morning:

I lost a needle in the process because that fabric is **thick**.

Hours later, it was time to brush out the fuzzy yarn to make it more like hair.

When I was done, it was time to take him for a walk.

I'll be giving Linda the gift on Wednesday after one of my meetings. I've included a photo collage to let her know, "yeah, I really made that and didn't buy it at the store!"  I've never made anything so realistic before.

And I'm definitely not making another one!
