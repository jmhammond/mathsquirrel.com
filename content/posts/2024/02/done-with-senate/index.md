> I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace; that two are called a law firm; and that three or more become a Congress! And, by God, I have had this Congress!

says a fictionalized John Adams addressing the Continental Congress in the musical *1776*. 


I've served on the Faculty Senate for five years now, and been on the Executive Committee as Secretary of the Senate for four years, and we've certainly accomplished some good things. But right now, things are annoying and so I'm in a complaining mood. Let me get that part off my chest. 

## Grumpy reflections

### Academic Integrity Policy proposals 2022 - 2024

Over the last three years, we've tried to enact changes to the academic integrity policy. In 2022 and 2023, both attempts were large and over-arching. Both years, the Senate tabled the proposal, giving it not a death, but an un-life.  The proposals expired without a vote. 

This year, I'm chairing the academic integrity committee, and my goal this year was to make the one smallest possible incremental change that would improve the process. Our Student Conduct Office proposed a one-sentence amendment to the policy that would improve their lives by empowering their office to give educational requirements with a view of descreasing recidivism.  If this proposal is tabled at Monday's meeting, it will be the third year of the Senate standing in the way of fixing an academic integrity system that needs tweaking.  

And I'll just put out here that the Senator in the previous years who tabled the bill in 2022 and 2023 has never filed an Academic Integrity report in his life; never used our system.  I grant that big restructuring of the system in those years was maybe too much... but this year it's the smallest incremental fix... if it fails, well, I will be fully bummed. 

### Did you read the proposals? 

This year it was glaringly obvious the Senators were not doing their homework. The most glaring instance of this came when our University President presented to the Senate on a matter involving program review to the Board of Regents.  Several Senators asked him questions, suggesting they didn't read any of the provided to understand what was being discussed. President Muma very patiently told his last interlocuter that he should read the proposal before asking questions.  

Next hand raised, "I agree with Senator (whomever). I also want to know (repeats the uninformed words of whomever)." So not only did this individual not do the homework, he didn't listen to the President's previous responses!  Sadly this is not an isolated case. Those two in particular, but not exclusively, regularly display this disservice to the Body. The Body doesn't feel august when we complain about something that is explicitly not related to a topic at hand.  

I can understand why no administrator wants to come to Senate meetings. This year, I'm a little embarassed to be a Senator.
