summary: "An actual email from a student this semester."
---

This is an actual email I received from a student: 

> I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I recently moved to Wichita from Cyprus .Due to the relocation process, I encountered delays that resulted in my late enrollment for your course. 
> 
> I regret missing the first week of lessons and understand the importance of the material covered during that time. I am eager to catch up and ensure that I do not fall behind. Could you please provide me with any information or materials from the first week, as well as any specific instructions on how I can best prepare for the upcoming classes? 
> 
> I appreciate your understanding and assistance in this matter. I am committed to making up for the missed content and fully engaging in the course.
> 
> Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your guidance.
> 
> Best regards,
>   
> [Your Full Name]
> 
> [Your Student ID] 
  
I sent an email that both ripped the student for not even reading what they wrote, and gave them terse but direct information about watching four hours of class videos, doing assignments posted, etc...  I can't believe the [rude adjective] students!

I initially shared this as a rage post to an internal chat because at first I wanted to share my outrage at people being idiots.  I took it down, because it would lead into a digression of us all bemoaning students, etc..

But now I'm writing this and posting it online because at the heart of this, we're losing the ability to communicate. I could have used Bing AI[^1] to write my response in outlook and hit send. At this point, it's two mindless computers talking to one another, not a human student and human instructor coming together to share knowledge. 

So I'm not bemoaning students for being idiots, instead I'm worried about our ability to see each other as people.

... But Dall-E's Cyprene robot sending an email is pretty great
