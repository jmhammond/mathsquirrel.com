summary: "A very brief evolution of my note taking apps, and coercing Obsidian to emulate the golden days of 2008."

I used to take a lot of notes at work. I had a pretty good system.  

Back in the olden days when I was a software developer, I kept my personal notes in Kate, the KDE text editor, and when I got a Mac, I moved over to Simple Note and then Notational Velocity.

It was incredibly simple -- you wanted to note something? Start typing -- if it exists, add to that note. If not, create a new note.

I've enjoyed tinkering with various note-taking systems over the years, from `org-mode` to Logseq and many in between.  Now I'm playing with Obsidian and I think I've got it working like Notational Velocity: 

- Install the Omnisearch plugin from the community plugin store
- Delete keybindings for New Note (CMD+n) and Create Note on the Right (CMD+SHIFT+n)
- Map CMD+N to Omnisearch Vault 
	- and I also use CMD+P for it as well (like how VS Code does it, the command pallet is mapped to CMD+SHIFT+P)

Now when I want to find a note, press CMD+n or CMD+p and start typing. If I typed "Notational Velocity" it finds this note and I'm ready to start editing it.  If it doesn't exist, Shift+Return creates a new note.  

And it works pretty well syncing with my phone, so thatâ€™s nice. 

So far, so good. ðŸ¤ž
