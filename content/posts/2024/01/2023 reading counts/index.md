Goodreads tells me that in 2023, I read 22,998 pages out of 77 books.   That's down from last year but not too bad (24,165 pages and 85 books). I was curious if that was a negative trend, and maybe it is, but then I looked at all my annual reports from Goodreads, represented here as charts:

## Books read over the years

I've definitely been reading a lot more in my late 30s! And considering I only read enough books to fit on two hands between high school and college, it's a miracle my librarian wife decided to marry me!
