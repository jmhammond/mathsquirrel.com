summary: "Tools I use, inspired by the community at uses.tech"

Inspired by the community posts at https://uses.tech, here's a list of my regular tools:

## Hardware:

- Macbook Air M1 (2020), base model
- iPad Pro 11" (2021)
	- This is quite possibly the best technological device I've ever owned. It does most everything I want very well with great battery life.  Use it for teaching my classes, marking (digital) papers, reading articles, ... 
- iPhone SE (2023) 
	- This thing is a tank (just like the previous SE 2020). In a Rhinoshield bumper case and screen protector, I can hurl it across a room, startling my students. It's great. 
- Kindle Paperwhite (from 2018ish?)

## Software:

### Teaching: 
I attach my Macbook Air to the classroom's projector system and then fire up: 
- [Air Server](https://www.airserver.com/Mac) lets me AirPlay my iPad to my laptop. It runs the display inside a window, so that I can also resize it and then demo websites, use Desmos, Sage, etc.
- MS Teams for streaming and recording.
- GoodNotes 5 (the AI features of 6 don't appeal to me)

### Grading
- Students upload their work in OneNote's Class Notebook tied to our course. 
- I then mark them on my iPad using OneNote.
- Grades are noted in Numbers, then recorded in Excel, and finally imported into Blackboard. It's tedious, but it works!

### General
- Mail:  Apple Mail and Outlook.  I can't make up my mind.
- Calendar: Apple Calendar
- Browsing: Safari primarily because it's so fast, Firefox when I want to use Containers. Edge for university work -- it syncs with our AD credentials for easier access to university resources.
- Screenshots: SnagIt
- Code: VS Code and Emacs
- Notes: Obsidian 
- Reading: Kindle, Readwise Reader, Zotero
- More: Espanso, Nextcloud, Tailscale, Amphetamine, AltTab, NoTunes
