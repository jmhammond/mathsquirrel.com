> I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace; that two are called a law firm; and that three or more become a Congress! And, by God, I have had this Congress!

says a fictionalized John Adams addressing the Continental Congress in the musical *1776*. 


I've served on the Faculty Senate for five years now, and been on the Executive Committee as Secretary of the Senate for four years, and we've certainly accomplished some good things. But right now, this year, things are incredibly annoying. I think it would be beneficial to reflect on the positive.
