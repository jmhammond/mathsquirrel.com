Section 3.5, Summary of Curve Sketching
<!--more-->

The examples in this section use everything we've learned for the previous four sections all at once. As a result, each video is quite long. Pause when you need to and ask any questions that you have!


## Curve Sketching Guidelines
Guidelines: A Sketching Checklist
(and they really are guidelines, not hard rules)

1. Find domain
1. Find intercepts
1. Does the function have symmetry? (Even / odd / periodic?)
1. Find asymptotes: vertical and horizontal
1. Find intervals of increasing and decreasing
1. Find local maximum and minimum values
1. Find concavity and points of inflection
1. Sketch the curve.

### Example 
Sketch 
$$
f(x) = \dfrac{2x^2}{x^2-1}
$$

### Example
Sketch the graph of 
$$
y = \sqrt[3]{x^2-1}
$$
