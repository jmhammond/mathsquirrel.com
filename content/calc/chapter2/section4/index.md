Section 2.4, derivatives of trig functions
<!--more-->

# Derivatives of Trig Functions

We saw last time the derivatives of sine and cosine which will be repeated here: 

* $\dfrac{d}{dx} (\sin (x)) = \cos (x)$

* $\dfrac{d}{dx} (\cos (x)) =- \sin (x)$

Let's use them to derive[^1] the rest of the formulas.

## Tangent and cotangent

* $\dfrac{d}{dx}( \tan(x)) = \sec^{2}(x)$

   We saw this last time, too. Use the quotient rule. If you don't remember, try it again! 

* $\dfrac{d}{dx} (\cot(x)) = -\csc^{2}(x)$

   Follow the same approach and use the quotient rule. Ask questions if you are unsure where to go.

## Secant and cosecant

* $\dfrac{d}{dx} (\sec(x)) = \sec (x) \tan (x)$

{{< youtube 0Kh_WzNKSUs >}}

* $\dfrac{d}{dx} (\csc(x)) = \csc (x) \cot (x)$

   Repeat the above argument with cosecant and verify you can get this one.

## Putting them all together 

### Many examples

1. Find the derivative of $y = x^2 \sec (x)$

{{< youtube vqH13_mHTDY >}}

2. Differentiate with respect to $t$, $y = \cos t + \sqrt{t}\sin(t)$

{{< youtube k9btUeW9fQg >}}

3. Find the slope of the line tangent to $y = 3x \sin x$  at the point $(\pi/2, 3\pi/2)$

{{< youtube RPPYj3NiX8s >}}

Here's a picture (the blue line is $y=3x$ while the green curve is $y=3x\sin x$).

4. A ladder 20 ft long rests against a vertical wall. Let ùúÉ be the angle between the top of the ladder and the wall and let *x* be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall. If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall, how fast does $x$ change with respect to $\theta$ when $\theta = \pi/4$?

## Now some limits

Here's an important limit that we'll come back to often:

$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin t}{t} = 1
$$

and 

$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\cos(t) - 1}{t} = 0
$$

### Deriving the derivative of sine.

Let's use the definition of the derivative to find the derivative of $\sin x$.

$$
\frac{d}{dx} (\sin x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{\sin(x + h) - \sin(x)}{h}
$$

### Finding more complicated limits

Find the limit $\displaystyle \lim_{t \to 0} \dfrac{\sin(4t)}{\tan(20t)}$

[^1]: Note that the word "derive" means "come up with." It doesn't mean 'find the derivative,' though in this case we are **deriving** the *derivative*.
