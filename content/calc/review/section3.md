New Functions from Old Functions

The following videos are lecture videos covering the material from Section 1.3 in Stewart's Calculus 8th edition. Each major topic in the section is broken down into a short video. 

---

In the first video we investigate the horizontal and vertical translations of functions and the corresponding algebraic relationships related to these geometric translations.
