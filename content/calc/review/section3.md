**Section 1.3 - New Functions from Old Functions**

The following videos are lecture videos covering the material from Section 1.3 in Stewart's Calculus 8th edition. Each major topic in the section is broken down into a short video. 

---

In the first video we investigate the horizontal and vertical translations of functions and the corresponding algebraic relationships related to these geometric translations.
