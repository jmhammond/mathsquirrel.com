##  First, a couple refreshers from Physics

### Units

"Units are your friend," -- Dr. Elizabeth Behrman 

|Measurement|SI Units|'American'|
|---|---|---|
|Mass|kg|â€¦ |
|Distance|m|ft|
|Velocity|m/s|ft/s|
|Acceleration|$\text{m/s}^2$|$\text{ft/s}^2$|
|Force|N=$\text{kg m/s}^2$|lb|
|Work|J = N m = $\text{kg m}^2/\text{s}^2$|ft-lb|
|Density| $\text{kg/m}^3$ | $\text{lb/ft}^3$|

### Formulas

- Recall that Force = mass * accelation 
  $F=ma$
  
- Work is force exerted for a distance 
  $W = Fd$
  
### Example, worked two ways

If I push a 2kg book with constant acceleration $1 \text{m/s}^2$ over the table 5m, how  much total work is acted on the book?
  
#### Solution 1:

First, find the force:
$\begin{align*} F &= ma \\ &= ( 2\text{kg} ) ( 1 \text{m/s}^2 ) = 2 \text{N} \end{align*}$

Second, find the work: 
$\begin{align*}  W &= Fd \\ &= ( 2\text{N}  )( 5 \text{m} ) \\ &= 10 \text{Nm} \\ &= 10 \text{J}  \end{align*}$

 
#### Solution 2: 

Let's graph with force along the $y$ axis and distance along the $x$ axis.

Since our time ranges from $x=0m$ and $x=5m$, we could compute the integral with the function $f(x) = 2\text{N}$

$\begin{align*} W = \int_{0\text{m}}^{5\text{m}} 2 \text{N} \\, dx &= (2\text{N}) x \Big|_{x=0m}^{5m} \\  &= (2\text{N})(5 \text{m})- (2\text{N})(0\text{m}) \\ &= 10 \text{N} \end{align*}$

  
## Force varying across distance

What if the force changes at different points through the distance? In this example, let's imagine that from 1 meter to 2, we are exerting more and more force. From 2 meters to 3, we push at a consistent force of 3 N; after three meters, we're tired so we back off our force down; from 4 to 5 meters, it's a consant 5 meters.

Let's find the work using integrals!

$\begin{align*} W &= \int_1^5 f(x) \\, dx \\ &= \int_1^2 f(x) \\, dx + \int_2^3 f(x) \\, dx \\ &= \int_3^4 f(x)\\, dx \\ &= \int_4^5 f(x) \\, dx \\ &= 2 + 3 + 1.5 + 1 \\ &= 7.5 \text{Nm}   \\ &= 7.5 \text{J} \end{align*}$

## Example 

A particle moves along the $x$ axis at a force of $\dfrac{10}{(1+x)^2}$ pounds at $x$ feet from the origin. Find the work done moving the particle to 9 feet from the origin.

Solution:
Here the force is $f(x) = \dfrac{10}{(1+x)^2} \text{lb}$. 
So 
$\begin{align*} W = \int_a^b f(x) \\, dx &= \int_{0}^{9\text{ft}} \dfrac{10}{(1+x)^2} \text{lb} \\, dx  \end{align*}$
... integrate (hint: $u$-substitution $u=1+x$)
...
and so the force is $9 \text{ft-lb}$. 


## Hooke's Law
The force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to the distance past its natural length

$F = kx$ wehre $x$ is the distance from the natural length and $k$ is the *spring constant*

### Example 
Suppose $2\text{J}$ of work is required to stretch the spring from its natural length of 30cm to 40cm. How much work is needed to stretch from 35cm to 45cm?

## Work to empty a tank

Here's the process we're going to follow (I'm typing this out for future reference, jump down to the example): 

1. Define a coordinate system 
    Figure out where your origin should be
2. Find the cross-sectional area of a "sheet" of water 
    Just as we found cross-sections of washers / cylinders when computing volumes
3. Find the volume of that "infinitesimal sheet" of water
   Since Volume = Area * height: 
   Volume = Area $dx$  
4. Find the force that is exerted on the sheet
   Force = volume*density 
5. Find the work needed to "lift" the sheet out
   Work = Force * distance
   This will define a function which varies on distance.
6. Find the total amount of work required. 
    ... the sum of all infinitesimal work will be an integral! 

### Example

Imagine a rectangular pool with dimensions 15ft x 8ft x 4ft is filled with 3ft of  water.  Find the amount of work that is needed to pump all of the water from the pool  over its side [use the fact that water's density is $62.5 \text{lb/ft}^2$].

### Example

An example with a variable cross-sectional area.
Ex: Find the work required to empty the water from a full, hemispherical pool  which has a diameter of 10ft, pumping the water directly over the edge.
