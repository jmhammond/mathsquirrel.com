## History of mathematical notations
This is a link to [Florian Cajori's History of Mathematical Notations, volume 2](https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002/page/14/mode/2up). Specifically, it points to the history of the dollar sign, $, because that might be an interesting entry point into the book.

## Resources for Cubics (Cardano, Tartaglia, and more)

- Here's a link to [Cardano's _Ars Magna_](https://archive.org/details/arsmagnaorruleso0000card) translated into English (requires free Archive.org account).

- [_The Book of My Life_](https://archive.org/details/GirolamoCardanoTheBookOfMyLifeDeVitaPropriaLiber/page/n13/mode/2up) [by Cardano.](https://archive.org/details/GirolamoCardanoTheBookOfMyLifeDeVitaPropriaLiber/page/n13/mode/2up)¬† I'm linking to the table of contents. I forgot to mention that he is also an astrologer. The second paragraph of chapter two, "My Nativity" discusses his own horoscope (later in life he gets in trouble for casting the horoscope of Jesus).
    -  Personal comment: it's been awhile since I've just sat with Cardano. Reading this now I'm reminded that he's a really repellant and truly toxic person. Fun story and big deal in history, but I am glad to not interact with him.
    -  ... but, between complaints, discussing twenty-three years of lawsuits, and all, he gives a very broad list of things that make him happy and can bring happiness to everyone:
> Let us live, therefore, cheerfully... if there is any good thing by which you would adorn this stage of life, we have not of such been cheated - rest, serenity, modesty, self-restraint, orderliness, change, fun, entertainment, society, temperance, sleep, food, drink, riding, sailing, walking, keeping abreast of events, meditation, contemplation, education, piety, marriage, feasting, the satisfaction of recalling an orderly disposition of the past, cleanliness, water, fire, listening to music, looking at all about one, talks, stories history, liberty, continence, little birds, puppies, cats, consolation of death, and the common flux of time, fate, and fortune, over the afflicted and favored alike. There is good in the hope for things beyond all hope; good in the exercise of some art in which one is skilled; good in meditating upon the manifold transmutation of all nature and upon the magnitude of the Earth. (pages 122-3)

- The poem, translated into English, preserving the rhyme structure.
  - Gutman, K. O. (2005). Quando Che‚Äôl Cubo. _Mathematical Intelligencer_,¬†_27_(1), 32‚Äì36.¬†
    
    [Link to pdf](/history/Gutman2005.pdf)

- The "play" form of the letters of Cardano and Tartaglia
  - Nordgaard, M. A. (1938). Sidelights on the Cardan-Tartaglia Controversy.¬†_National Mathematics Magazine_,¬†_12_(7), 327‚Äì346.¬†
    [Link to pdf](/history/Nordgaard1938.pdf)¬†

- This book is excellent and should be read cover-to-cover for any topic. In particular there is a great chapter on Cardano and Tartaglia along with Cardano's geometric proof of the cubic formula (remember that everything is backed up with geometry! A "cube" means a literal cube.
